# magrittr introduces a new operator, %>%, called a pipe, which can be used to chain functions together. Calls that you would otherwise write as

new_variable <- function_2(function_1(your_data))

#can be written as

your_data %>% function_1 %>% function_2 -> new_variable

#example

airquality %>%
      subset(Temp > 80) %>% 
      inset("Wind", value = .$Wind * 0.44704) %>%
      aggregate(Wind ~ Month, data = ., FUN = mean) ->
      hot_wind_means
      
      # native pipe, |>
      
      # Taken from the book, "Modern Statistics with R"
