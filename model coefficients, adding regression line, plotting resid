# Check model coefficients:
coef(m)

# Add regression line to plot:
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
      geom_point() + 
      geom_abline(aes(intercept = coef(m)[1], slope = coef(m)[2]),
                colour = "red")
                
# Diagnostic plots for the residuals are obtained using plot:

plot(m)
