#3.4.2 Saving and loading R data
#Being able to export to different spreadsheet formats is very useful, but sometimes you want to save an object that can’t be saved in a spreadsheet format. For instance, you may wish to save a machine learning model that you’ve created. .RData files can be used to store one or more R objects.

#To save the objects bookstore and age in a .Rdata file, we can use the save function:

save(bookstore, age, file = "myData.RData")
#To save all objects in your environment, you can use save.image:

save.image(file = "allMyData.RData")
#When we wish to load the stored objects, we use the load function:

load(file = "myData.RData")
